The exercises focussed on teaching `numpy`, `scipy`, `matplotlib`, `cartopy`
and `xarray`.

- [fundamentals/](fundamentals/): fundamentals in python-based data-analysis,
  based off [Michael Zingale's

- [cases/2006_07_31](cases/2006_07_31): Reproducing analysis and figures from
  Birch et al 2013 which studied a Mesoscale Convective System on and around
  31st June 2006.

- [participant-examples/](participant-examples/): examples based on problems
  and questions from participants at the workshop. Includes examples of using
  Kriging, working with CSV files, regridding and working with BUFR files.

- [gssti-hpc/](gstti-hpc): examples of what can be done with Python by: 1)
