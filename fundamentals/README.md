All exercises is this folder are taken from Michael Zingale's graduate course
in scientific programming with python
(http://bender.astro.sunysb.edu/classes/python-science/).

If this is your first experience with Python you should start by familiarising
yourself with the background material in `background/`

Hans Petter Langtange's "A Primer on Scientific Programming with Python" is
highly recommended: https://hplgit.github.io/primer.html/doc/pub/half/book.pdf
