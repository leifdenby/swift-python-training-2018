# Case study of MSC development 2006-07-31

This case involves the study of a parent storm triggering a daughter storm over
a moist patch of land (created from precipitation of a storm on the previous
day).

The storm happened during the AMMA campaign and was analysed by Birch et al
2013 using different observational products (satellite of precipitation,
cloud-top temperature, soil-moisture) and simulation data (ECMWF ERA-Interim
and MetOffice Unified Model).

The intention for this exercise is for you to recreate each plot uncovering the
story in the paper and create your own interpretation of the results. Once
finished you may compliment your study using further datasets (radar
observations, ground-based measurements and radio-sondes where available). All
data has been downloaded for you and is available in `data/`

The exercises are in exercises/ and the paper referred to is available too
`Birch_2013_QJRMS_139.pdf`

Time to do some real science!
