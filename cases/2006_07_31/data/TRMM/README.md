TRMM_3B42: TRMM (TMPA) Rainfall Estimate L3 3 hour 0.25 degree x 0.25 degree V7

> This dataset is the output from the TMPA (TRMM Multi-satellite Precipitation)
Algorithm, and provides precipitation estimates in the TRMM regions that have
the (nearly-zero) bias of the ”TRMM Combined Instrument” precipitation estimate
and the dense sampling of high-quality microwave data with fill-in using
microwave-calibrated infrared estimates. The granule size is 3 hours.

All data in this folder was downloaded using wget FROM the NASA eosdis server
via the GES DISC webinterface:
